          VANK Coop Cooperative and VANK Wallet
          By signing up on the form available on the Vank Wallet website, you automatically become a member of
          the VANK COOP Cooperative and are to abide by the rules associated with the operations of the
          Cooperative and the wallet.
          Every property listed on Vank Wallet will be represented in token units which signify ownership of such
          property. Users can buy fractions of a property by paying with their wallet balance and their amount of
          ownership of a property will also be represented in their wallets. Users should be aware that holding a
          fraction of the total tokens in a property does not grant full ownership of the property and therefore
          means that fractional token holders in a property may not take possession of or build on the property
          until they have bought up 100% of such property. Users will however be able to hold, sell, or borrow
          against the value of their property tokens within the VANK Wallet dashboard once sell and borrowing
          functionality is enabled.
          Co-owned property are allocated in the name of the VANK Coop and kept in trust for cooperative
          members. The management team of VANK Coop may take key decisions that affect the listed property
          relating to its maintenance, sale, and development. Proceeds of such decisions such as a sale will be
          distributed to the wallets of token holders. Property bought outright by a user may be allocated in that
          user’s name at the user’s request.
          Token holders may take a loan from VANK Wallet using the tokens as security. Holders shall qualify for
          loans which are a fraction of the current market value of their tokens. The loan amount available to a
          user will be viewable on his dashboard. Every loan transaction will attract a monthly interest of 6%.
          Default shall trigger an additional 2% penalty and a sale of the user’s tokens sufficient to cover the user’s
          loan plus penalty. The rest of the user’s tokens will be available to the user.
          3
          For “Ongoing Development’ projects, tokens may be issued in a phased manner which may increase the
          number of tokens linked to a property. The additional tokens will always represent real value addition in
          the form of improvements to the documentation, building, branding, etc of the existing property. To
          ensure strict adherence additional tokens will be released only under strict supervision by a reputable
          audit firm.
          By signing up and buying tokens of listed property on VANK Wallet, the user confirms their acceptance
          of these terms and conditions.

          the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any breach of any
          provision of these Terms will constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the
